# Now

A service to bug you repeatedly about what you're doing.

Ever wondered where all that time goes? *Now* will help you collect that data.
Once running, *now* will simply pop up a text editor window when it wants to
know what you're doing, and all you have to do is type in what you're doing
right now - it works best if you're honest and tell it what has your attention
the moment it appears.

This is a maturing of sjmarshy/tagtime.js and, as such, an advance on
dreeves/tagtime. The differences are mainly in technology, but also in the
approach - *now* will only deal with the collection and storing of your
stats, and another application I'm working on will handle aggregating and
displaying all of the information - *then*.
